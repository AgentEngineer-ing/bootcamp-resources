# Week 1: Foundation

> Building the fundamentals for agent engineering success

## Learning Objectives
By the end of this week, you will:
- Set up a complete development environment for agent engineering
- Understand core concepts of agent engineering and its applications
- Build your first functional AI agent

## Schedule

### Day 1: Development Environment Setup
**Focus**: Project structure and coding tools

üìÅ **[01 - Dev Environment](./01-dev-environment/)**
- IDE setup and configuration
- Python environment management
- Git and version control
- Essential development tools

### Day 2: Agent Engineering Fundamentals  
**Focus**: Understanding what agent engineering is

üìÅ **[02 - Agent Engineering Basics](./02-agent-engineering-basics/)**
- What is an AI agent?
- Agent vs. traditional AI applications
- Key components and architectures
- Industry use cases and examples

### Day 3: Building Your First Agent
**Focus**: Hands-on agent development

üìÅ **[03 - Building First Agent](./03-building-first-agent/)**
- Setting up LangChain
- Creating a simple conversational agent
- Adding memory and context
- Testing and debugging

## Key Resources

### Required Reading

- **OpenAI API** - Language model access
- **Git** - Version control

### Daily Coding Sessions
Each day includes live coding with practical examples:
- [Day 1 Session](../../daily-sessions/week-1/day-1.md) - Environment setup
- [Day 2 Session](../../daily-sessions/week-1/day-2.md) - First API calls
- [Day 3 Session](../../daily-sessions/week-1/day-3.md) - Agent implementation

## Assignments

### Mini-Projects
1. **Environment Verification** - Complete setup checklist
2. **API Integration** - Make your first OpenAI API call
3. **Simple Agent** - Build a basic Q&A agent

### Week 1 Capstone
Build a **Personal Assistant Agent** that can:
- Answer questions about your interests
- Remember conversation context
- Provide helpful suggestions

## Prerequisites
- Basic Python knowledge
- Familiarity with command line
- GitHub account

## Next Week Preview
Week 2 will dive into advanced techniques:
