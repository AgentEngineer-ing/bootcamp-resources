# Agent Engineering Fundamentals

> Core concepts and principles of building intelligent AI agents

## What is Agent Engineering?

Agent engineering is the discipline of designing, building, and deploying AI systems that can act autonomously to achieve specific goals. Unlike traditional AI applications that respond to direct inputs, agents can:

- **Plan and execute** multi-step tasks
- **Interact with environments** and other systems
- **Learn and adapt** from experience
- **Make decisions** based on context and objectives

## Key Concepts

### Agent vs. Traditional AI
| Traditional AI | AI Agents |
|---------------|-----------|
| Single input → output | Multi-step reasoning |
| Stateless interactions | Persistent state and memory |
| Reactive responses | Proactive planning |
| Limited context | Rich environmental awareness |

### Core Agent Components

#### 1. **Perception**
- Input processing and understanding
- Environmental awareness
- Context interpretation

#### 2. **Reasoning**
- Goal planning and decomposition
- Decision making logic
- Problem-solving strategies

#### 3. **Action**
- Tool execution and API calls
- Environmental manipulation
- Response generation

#### 4. **Memory**
- Short-term working memory
- Long-term knowledge storage
- Experience-based learning

## Agent Architectures

### ReAct Pattern (Reasoning + Acting)
The most common agent pattern that alternates between reasoning and acting:

```
Thought: I need to find information about the weather
Action: search_weather("San Francisco")
Observation: Temperature is 72°F, sunny
Thought: I have the weather information, I can respond
Action: respond("The weather in San Francisco is 72°F and sunny")
```

### Multi-Agent Systems
Multiple specialized agents working together:
- **Coordinator Agent** - Orchestrates tasks
- **Specialist Agents** - Handle specific domains
- **Communication Protocols** - Inter-agent messaging

### Hierarchical Agents
Agents with different levels of abstraction:
- **High-level Planning** - Strategic decisions
- **Mid-level Coordination** - Task management
- **Low-level Execution** - Specific actions

## Real-World Applications
